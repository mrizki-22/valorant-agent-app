A former firefighter and soldier from Baltimore, Byrne is fiercely loyal to all his allies and organizations, always keeps his squadmates close. But although he would do anything for them, Byrne hasn't always been able to save everyone. After the death of a close friend, Tariq Porter, his loss greatly affected Byrne, haunted by what had happened despite all his own best efforts to save him. It was around this time that he would then join Kingdom Corporation, giving him something at a time when he needed it most.

            "Tayane Alves is an engineer coming from Salvador, Bahia, Brazil, with a strong enthusiasm for explosives and paint - usually combined. Holding strong objections towards Kingdom Corporation's operations in Bahia, Alves was involved in driving the company out of her home state and forcing them to abandon their sites there, the marks of her tools staining the plots as a testament to her victories. Hired since then to work for the VALORANT Protocol as its twelfth agent, \"Raze\", Alves now sows her chaos against bigger threats to Earth. However, as the paint fades from Salvador's walls, Raze cannot afford to leave her home completely behind, lest Kingdom look to make its return there.",

            "A criminal from Sweden, Erik Torsten was set to be convicted along with the rest of his family for their crimes. As he was a double congenital amputee however, the judge was pitiful and lenient towards him, giving him a smaller sentence that soon allowed Erik to return to his old ways. Building himself his own mechanical arms to use, Erik would hit back with his own criminal assignments, becoming so notorious for the terrible things he had done that he eventually had to go into hiding and effectively exile himself from his home. During these times, he also encountered the young Brazilian Tayane Alves, who worked alongside him for a while and provided some major upgrades to his arms, resulting in the carbon-steel titanium-plating version that he uses to this day.",
